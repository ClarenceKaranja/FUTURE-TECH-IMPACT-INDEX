The doctor blade of the present invention and the method for manufacturing the same are characterised in that the doctor blade mostly consists of two layers of plastic material. One of the layers forms at least the main part of the body (48) of the doctor blade (40) and one of the lateral surfaces of the doctor blade (40). The other layer (46) made of a more wear-proof material forms at least partially the other opposite lateral surface of the doctor blade (40).\n",
